# Airbnb
Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking. In this project, we aim to use algorithms and libraries to mine the reviews people have submitted on Singapore AirBnB rentals in order to provide descriptive analytics.
